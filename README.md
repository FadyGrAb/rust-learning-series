I'm currently trying to learn Rust so I've created this series to document and summarize my learning journey. I'll loosely follow the content of _"The Rust Programming Language, 2nd Edition"_ by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols which I use as my main learning source for Rust (at least for now ðŸ˜‰)  

This series is more for the "intermediate-level" programmer. It won't go throw programming fundamentals details here. My main programming language is Python, so you will see me compare Rust to Python a lot.  

I'll publish this series on [Dev.to](https://dev.to) as short, concise and bite-size articles each one will discuss a single Rust topic. his repo will contain any code snippets that I may use in those articles.
